****Aerial Photogrammetry Scanning of Architecture Scale Structure****

**-- Safety:**
Before we begin, we must visit Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
website to learn how to fly safely a drone. Rules and procedures for a safe flight are applied to all types of drones and operations.

**-- High Level concept of photogrammetry scanning:**
To scan a building or an object, we simply take sequentially multiple images of all possible sides and surfaces. Each image must have a 50-60% overlap 
with the subsequent one. The produced dataset is then processed in a photogrammetry software in order to create a 3D model with texture mapping.


**-- Manual Operation:**
1. Drone OFF
2. The pilot and the observer are always in visual contact with the drone and ensure safety.
3. The pilot and the observer are always in visual contact with the structure they are going to scan.
4. Planning of the flight in terms of elements of hazards or collision is a must (trees, cables, vehicles, birds).
5. Planning of the flight in terms of scanning strategy to ensure battery management and smooth scanning of surfaces. 
6. the pilot and the observer clear up the take off and emergency landing area before take off.

1. Drone ON
2. Pilot orients him/her/themselves in the same  direction with the drone. Front, left, right, back in the controller corresponds to the same action of pilot's body orientation

1. Take OFF and hover over the ground testing all controller actions (move forward, backward, up, down, left, right, rotate).
2. Slowly fly over the area of capturing to confirm obstacles or limitations of the environment around the structure.
